I am a student in Tsinghua University, China, majored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, interested in Analysis, especially Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Solutions. In the following years, I would try some graduate programs in Qiuzhen College, Tsinghua University. Beside academical life, I have some hobbies, basically including swimming, calligraphy, chatting with friends.
